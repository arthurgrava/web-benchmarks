# Web Benchmarks

This repository contains code that I created to run simple tests on web frameworks that I would like to test
and collect information. When I see fit, I'll add more information here.

**IMPORTANT**: I know the code is not nice at the moment, no dependency injection, organization is a mess and you can
name a lot more! I just do not care at this stage! Perhaps I'll make it nicer in the future.
